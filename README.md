# Ludum Dare 23

This game is DONE.

There are probably a few gnarly bugs left, and there's probably at least one way to get yourself into an unwinnable situation. I'm going to be ironing out any game-killing stuff and making ports soon (24h).

## Compiling from source on OSX:

     port install py-game

     python main.py

## Compiling from source on Ubuntu:
